# TODO List for Moka-DOM

## High Priority

1. Add support for websockets and potentially HTMX
2. Improve error handling especially on the Haskell js interface, perhaps something better than IO
3. Provide first class nix support with a derivation and/or flakes
4. Add support for more advanced event handling (e.g., event delegation)

## Medium Priority

1. Create an example project using this library
2. Add examples and tutorials to the README
3. Provide tooling to make development and testing easier

## Low Priority

1. Support for using webview apps on android and IOS
2. Implement bindings for more complex DOM APIs (e.g., WebGL, Web Audio)
3. Explore integration with other Haskell libraries
4. Add benchmarks to compare performance

## Ongoing Tasks

- Keep up-to-date with changes in the GHC JavaScript backend
- Regularly update dependencies
- Address issues and pull requests from the community

## Future Considerations

- Explore the possibility of generating Haddock documentation compatible with the GHC JavaScript backend
- Consider creating a separate package for advanced DOM features
- Investigate integration with JavaScript build tools and bundlers
- Investigate the possibility of adding getting HLS to work or create a lightweight LSP

Please feel free to contribute to any of these tasks or suggest new ones by opening an issue or pull request!
